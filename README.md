## Archetype Overview

Each archetype represents a different ecological strategy with specialized traits and behaviors:

| Archetype | Strategy | Key Traits | Ecological Niche |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Foraging Mat** | Resource harvesting | High water need, moderate transport | Aquatic margins, nutrient processing |
| **Cord/Creeper** | Network building | High transport, strong trail deposition | Connecting habitats, resource highways |
| **Tower/Canopy** | Light exploitation | High photosynthesis, low predation | Bright areas, primary production |
| **Floater/Raft** | Aquatic adaptation | Water affinity, balanced traits | Water bodies, amphibious zones |
| **Engulfer** | Predatory | High predation, no photosynthesis | Competition-heavy areas, population control |
| **Scout/Prospector** | Exploration | Large sensing range, high nutrient weight | Edge exploration, resource discovery |
