## Archetype Overview

Each archetype represents a different ecological strategy with specialized traits and behaviors:

| Archetype | Strategy | Key Traits | Ecological Niche |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Foraging Mat** | Resource harvesting | High water need, moderate transport | Aquatic margins, nutrient processing |
| **Cord/Creeper** | Network building | High transport, strong trail deposition | Connecting habitats, resource highways |
| **Tower/Canopy** | Light exploitation | High photosynthesis, low predation | Bright areas, primary production |
| **Floater/Raft** | Aquatic adaptation | Water affinity, balanced traits | Water bodies, amphibious zones |
| **Engulfer** | Predatory | High predation, no photosynthesis | Competition-heavy areas, population control |
| **Scout/Prospector** | Exploration | Large sensing range, high nutrient weight | Edge exploration, resource discovery |

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Modern web browser with HTML5 Canvas support
- No installation, build process, or external dependencies required

### Running the Simulation
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser
2. Adjust simulation parameters in the left panel
3. Use environmental overlays to visualize different data layers
4. Click colonies to inspect their traits and genealogy
5. Spawn new colonies manually using the archetype buttons

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Step one simulation tick |
| `P` | Toggle pause/play |
| `R` | Reset simulation with new random seed |
| `S` | Save PNG screenshot |
| `Esc` | Cancel colony spawning mode |

### Configuration

Simulation parameters can be adjusted in real-time:

- **Seed**: Deterministic world generation (integer)
- **World Size**: Grid dimensions (128×72 to 256×144)
- **Speed**: Simulation rate multiplier (0.1× to 4.0×)
- **Mutation Rate**: Trait variation intensity (0% to 100%)
- **Carrying Capacity**: Population density limit (0.1× to 2.0×)

## Advanced Usage

### Experimental Design
