# Slime Mold Aggregation System - Design & Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for enhancing the Slimeworld Evolution Simulator with realistic slime mold aggregation behavior, modeling the transition from individual amoeba to coordinated multicellular masses.

## Design Document

### Current State Analysis

**Existing System:**
- Individual colonies expand continuously when conditions are favorable
- No inter-colony communication or aggregation mechanics
- Colony behavior is purely local (based on immediate environmental conditions)
- No distinction between individual cellular phase and collective multicellular phase

### Biological Inspiration

Real slime molds exhibit a fascinating lifecycle:
- **Individual Phase**: When food is plentiful, amoebas exist and feed separately
- **Stress Response**: When food becomes scarce, they release chemical signals
- **Aggregation**: Cells clump together following chemical gradients to form multicellular masses  
- **Collective Behavior**: The mass behaves as a coordinated unit, moving collectively to find better locations
- **Fruiting**: Individual cells can develop into stalked fruiting bodies to release spores

### Proposed System Architecture

#### 1. Dual-Phase Lifecycle System

**Individual Amoeba Phase:**
- New base state where colonies exist as small, dispersed individual cells
- Cells move independently and feed separately
- Low coordination, high individual mobility
- Triggered by high nutrient availability

**Aggregated Mass Phase:**
- Occurs when multiple colonies detect nutrient scarcity
- Forms larger, coordinated multicellular structures
- Enhanced collective movement and resource sensing
- Can eventually develop into spore-producing fruiting bodies

#### 2. Chemical Signaling Network

**Stress Signal System:**
- New chemical layer: `World.signals.stress` (similar to existing slime trail system)
- Emitted by colonies experiencing nutrient deficiency
- Diffuses and evaporates over time like slime trails
- Concentration indicates local food scarcity levels

**Aggregation Pheromone System:**
- Secondary signal: `World.signals.aggregation`
- Released when colonies detect stress signals above threshold
- Creates chemical gradients that guide cell movement toward aggregation sites
- Higher concentration = stronger aggregation attraction

#### 3. Dynamic Colony States

**State Enumeration:**
```javascript
const ColonyStates = {
    INDIVIDUAL: 'individual',    // Separate feeding cells
    AGGREGATING: 'aggregating',  // Moving toward aggregation site
    COLLECTIVE: 'collective',    // Coordinated multicellular mass
    FRUITING: 'fruiting'        // Spore-producing structure
};
```

**State Transition Logic:**
- `INDIVIDUAL ï¿½ AGGREGATING`: Triggered by detecting stress/aggregation signals
- `AGGREGATING ï¿½ COLLECTIVE`: When multiple colonies merge at aggregation point
- `COLLECTIVE ï¿½ FRUITING`: After successful relocation or prolonged collective phase
- `FRUITING ï¿½ INDIVIDUAL`: Spore dispersal creates new individual colonies

#### 4. Enhanced Environmental Response

**Nutrient Scarcity Detection:**
- Track local nutrient depletion rate over time windows
- Calculate "stress level" based on nutrient availability vs consumption
- Stress threshold determines when to initiate aggregation signaling

**Collective Sensing:**
- Aggregated masses have enhanced sensing range (larger than individual cells)
- Can detect nutrient gradients and optimal migration directions
- Coordinated movement toward better environmental conditions

#### 5. Modified Suitability Calculations

**Phase-Dependent Behavior:**
- Individual phase: Original suitability calculation (local optimization)
- Aggregating phase: Weighted toward aggregation pheromone gradients
- Collective phase: Long-range environmental gradient following
- Fruiting phase: Optimal spore dispersal site selection

**New Suitability Components:**
- `stress_signal_influence`: Attraction to stress signals during individual phase
- `aggregation_influence`: Following aggregation pheromones during aggregating phase
- `collective_mobility`: Enhanced movement range and coordination during collective phase

#### 6. Technical Considerations

**Performance Impact:**
- Additional chemical signal layers require memory similar to existing slime trails
- State transition calculations add computational overhead
- Colony merging/splitting operations need efficient data structure updates

**Backward Compatibility:**
- New behavior can be toggled via configuration flags
- Existing colony types maintain original behavior when aggregation is disabled
- Save/load system needs to handle new state and signal data

**UI Enhancements:**
- New overlay options for stress and aggregation signals
- Colony inspector shows current state and transition triggers
- Visual indicators for different lifecycle phases
